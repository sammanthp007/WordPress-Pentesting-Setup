# Week 7 Lab: WordPress Pentesting Setup

Challenge 0: Install Docker
Start by getting docker installed and running.

Docker has solid support for most major platforms, and you can follow their published instructions for downloading and installing on Mac or Windows. Additionally, you'll need to install docker-compose, a tool that lets us assemble designs based on multiple docker machines.

Tip: For arch linux, also add the user to docker group using ```gpasswd -a <user> docker```

Once installed, you'll typically need to start docker through its UI tool. But make sure docker is running & accessible from the command line:
```
docker ps
```

## Challenge 1: Running WordPress with Docker
- [x]: Running WordPress with Docker
To get started quickly, we'll use ``` docker-compose ``` to spin up a typical WP setup, using two containers: one for WP fronted by Apache, and another for the MySQL data store.

Create a new directory on your local machine for this lab. Any location under your user dir is appropriate .In that directory, create two new files, docker-compose.yml and .env:

Create ``` docker-compose.yml ``` with the following contents:
```
version: '2'

services:
   db:
     image: mysql:5.7
     volumes:
       - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
     restart: always
     environment:
       MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: wordpress
       MYSQL_DATABASE: wordpress
       MYSQL_USER: wordpress
       MYSQL_PASSWORD: wordpress

   wordpress:
     depends_on:
       - db
     image: wordpress:${WP_IMAGE_VERSION}
     ports:
       - "8000:80"
     restart: always
     environment:
       WORDPRESS_DB_HOST: db:3306
       WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD: wordpress
volumes:
    db_data:
```
Create ```.env``` with:
```
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=wp
WP_IMAGE_VERSION=latest
```
Now you should be able to launch the instance by running the following from the same directory:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
This will create a docker container using the latest published WordPress image, and should take approximately 5 - 10 minutes depending on connection speed.

> In Docker, an **image** is a filesystem and associated set of runtime parameters. It doesnâ€™t have state and never changes. A container is a running instance of an image. Learn more here.

Test that you can access the instance (note you may need to wait a minute or so after ```docker-compose up -d``` completes for the WordPress application to load): http://localhost:8000/

If all goes well, you should be prompted to pick a title, language, and administrator login for your new blog. Note a secure password is generated by default --- you'll need to keep track of that.
